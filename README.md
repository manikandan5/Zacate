#  Heuristic Search and Games

This code was written for the course Elements of Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-B 551) at Indiana University handled by Professor David Crandall. Skeleton code was provided by the Professor to get us started with the assignment.


**What does the program do?** <br/>
* The program has implementation of Artificial Intelligent player to play a game called Zacate.
* More details about the game can be found from this [link](https://github.com/manikandan5/Zacate/blob/master/Question.pdf).

**How does it find it?** <br/>

* The program calculates the expectation based on the probability and takes the best possible solution for the round.
* The program was ranked 3rd in a class of 80.

Detailed explanation about how the code works and the reason why we chose this implementation could be found [here](https://github.com/manikandan5/Zacate/blob/master/part2/ZacateAutoPlayer.py).
